MCP server for an AI assistant

# AgentBridge-MCP

A modular, extensible **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** server for secure and auditable AI agent task routing.

---

## 🔧 What is This?

This repo is a foundational **local MCP server** built with Python + FastAPI that:

- Accepts structured JSON requests for tasks
- Routes them to secure modular task handlers (e.g. email, CSV parsing, summarization)
- Can be extended for any AI agent or tool

---

## 🚀 What You Get Out of the Box

✅ FastAPI MCP server  
✅ Modular `task/` folder (e.g. echo, get_time)  
✅ Simple `POST /mcp` handler  
✅ Dispatch logic with task map  
✅ Ready for local testing & extension

---

## 💡 Why Use It?

This MCP server acts as the **command center** for AI agents.

It separates "what needs to be done" from "how it’s done" — enabling:
- 📦 Task modularity
- 🔐 A2SPA-compliant secure execution
- ⚡ Agent-Agnostic Logic (GPT, Claude, Ollama, etc.)
